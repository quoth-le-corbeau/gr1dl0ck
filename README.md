# my first gr1dl0ck crypto challenge

## Crypto Challenge Set 1
- This is the qualifying set. We picked the exercises in it to ramp developers up gradually into coding cryptography, but also to verify that we were working with people who were ready to write code.
-This set is relatively easy. With one exception, most of these exercises should take only a couple minutes. But don't beat yourself up if it takes longer than that. It took Alex two weeks to get through the set!
- Convert hex to base64
The string:  
`49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d`  
Should produce:  
`SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t`  
- Cryptopals Rule
Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.
